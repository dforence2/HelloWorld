          <h1>Project #3</h1>
        <p>From the coast of Guinea to the extremity of Abyssinia there is not a state, the Fantees only excepted, where the people are not, and as far as we know of them, always were, slaves; and their princes and great men traded with one another in slaves long before America was discovered.  </p>
        <p>The demand which the American colonies have occasioned, has probably given rise to many acts of tyranny and oppression in the sovereigns, in order to possess themselves of the slaves of their great men; but on the other hand it may have made them more careful of the lives of their own slaves or subjects, because of the profit they made by selling them.  </p>
        <p>A captain of an English ship who had offered the king of Dormi or Dehouma less than he had asked for five hundred of his slaves, was invited by him to dinner the following day; they dined in a tent, and when they were rising from the table, the king of Dormi said to the captain, You would not give me my price for my five hundred slaves, did you think I valued them too high?  You may now have them for half the money.  </p>
        <p>And ordering the back of the tent to be drawn up, the five hundred heads were shewn to him piled upon one another.</p>
